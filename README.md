# Dimensionality-Reduction
*Methodology*
The methodology for using random projection for dimension reduction is relatively simple and
consists of the following steps:
1. Choose the number of dimensions in the projected space: The number of dimensions in
the projected space should be smaller than the number of dimensions in the original
space, and it is typically chosen based on heuristics or statistical methods.

2. Generate the projection matrix: The projection matrix is a matrix of random numbers
that is used to map the data onto the lower-dimensional space. The size of the projection
matrix depends on the number of dimensions in the original and projected spaces.

3. Project the data: The data is projected onto the lower-dimensional space by multiplying
the data matrix by the projection matrix. The resulting matrix has the same number of
rows as the original data, but the number of columns is equal to the number of
dimensions in the projected space.

4. Optional: Normalize the data: The data in the projected space may be normalized to have
zero mean and unit variance, to standardize the data and make it easier to compare across
different dimensions.

5. Apply machine learning algorithms: The projected data can be used as input to machine
learning algorithms, such as clustering or classification algorithms, to analyze the data
and make predictions.
